#Forest_Fire_Detection

This project, focuses on detecting forest fires using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify images into two categories: "Fire" and "No Fire." The model is trained on a labeled image dataset using Python and popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. By applying image classification techniques and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, the project aims to contribute toward early warning systems for forest fire management. The entire implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook environment, making it easy to experiment, visualize results, and understand the step-by-step development process. This work demonstrates the practical use of AI in addressing environmental challenges and serves as a foundation for further improvements and deployment in real-world scenarios, such as integration with surveillance systems or drones for automated forest fire detection.

##Project Overview

Objective: To build a machine learning model capable of detecting forest fires from images, aiding in early warning systems and disaster management.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset comprising images categorized into two classes: 'Fire' and 'No Fire'. These images are used to train and evaluate the model's performance.

Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for image classification tasks. CNNs are well-suited for processing visual data and have been effective in various image recognition applications.

Training Process: The model is trained on the labeled dataset, learning to distinguish between images with and without fire. Techniques such as data augmentation may be used to enhance the model's robustness.

Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable detection capabilities.
